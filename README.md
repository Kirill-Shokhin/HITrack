# HITrack

This repository is a pipeline of three state-of-the-art human recognition models on a monocular image: [yolov7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7), 
[VitPose](https://github.com/ViTAE-Transformer/ViTPose) and [MHFormer](https://github.com/Vegetebird/MHFormer) - to create bounding boxes, 2D poses and 
3D poses respectively. By combining them, a 3D scene with people can be produced. 
But the transition from 2D to 3D requires stable tracking, so an Human Inertial Tracking system was developed, after which the repository is named.
